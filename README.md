# A taste of Client-side Unit testing

This repo includes the slides of a talk I did at [Mindera](http://mindera.com/), in one of our TechTalks, and a sample app with its corresponding unit tests.

##Why?
On one hand, it's important to have some concepts present when approaching a project to test, mainly if we come from a different context.

Besides that - personally - when switching from AngularJS (which as a framework has many features that make unit testing easy) to a jQuery-based project, we came into some obstacles while begining to unit test it, so in this presentation I also tried to document it.
